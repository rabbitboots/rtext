-- Load the module.
local rtext = require("rtext.rtext")


-- This will be our rtext instance. Before creating it, we first need to set up some
-- font-related structures.
local rt

do
	-- Set up at least one LÃ–VE Font.
	local font = love.graphics.newFont(24)

	-- Fonts go into Block Style tables, which provide additional metadata and drawing methods.
	local b_style = rtext.newBlockStyle(font)

	--[[
	The Block Style tables are attached to a FontGroup table, which allows rtext to select
	between regular, bold, italic and bold-italic font faces. In this example, we will
	implement only the regular font.
	--]]
	local f_grp = rtext.newFontGroup(b_style)

	-- Now, when creating the rtext instance, we must assign a table of font groups with
	-- string IDs. We must also pass in the ID representing the default font group.
	local font_groups = {
		norm = f_grp,
	}

	rt = rtext.newInstance(font_groups, "norm")

	-- To recap:
	-- Font -> Block Style -> FontGroup -> table of font groups with string IDs.
end


-- Let's generate a drawable document.
local sample = "[align left]Hello,\n[align center]World\n[align right]!"

local document = rt:makeDocument(sample, love.graphics.getWidth() / 4) -- (input, wrap_width)


function love.draw()

	-- Illustrate the wrap-limit:
	love.graphics.setColor(1, 0, 0, 1)
	love.graphics.line(document.wrap_w + 0.5, 0.5, document.wrap_w + 0.5, love.graphics.getHeight())
	love.graphics.setColor(1, 1, 1, 1)

	-- Draw the document:
	document:draw(0, 0)
