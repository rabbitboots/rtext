## About This Package

The `rtext` subdirectory is all that's needed when integrating RText into a project. The rest of this repo consists of demos, testing and documentation.


## What's missing?

* RTL text flow is not supported.

* Documentation is barebones and needs an overhaul.

* Needs a tutorial that walks through the setup process.

* Needs a "Ready-To-Go" setup template, fonts included, that covers basic usage.

* Maybe better support for simple documents, with a line-oriented parser (as opposed to tags within paragraphs).
